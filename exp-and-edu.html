		<!-- BETADWARF QA TESTER INTERN -->
		<h2>
			QA Tester Intern
			<div style="font-size: large;">BetaDwarf</div>
		</h2>
		<p>
			BetaDwarf is medium-size Danish game development company. 
			I worked there for 6 months and gained experience with how games are developed and kept stable in an agile development environment. 
			I performed various tasks including manual testing, interacting with users and writing automated tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			I got to work on three different projects in three different key parts of development: early, close to release, and released with regular updates. 
			I also gained valuable insight into how games are made in a professional setting, and exactly what competencies are required of teams that succeed in this industry. 
			It provided me with clear learning goals that I have since actively pursued in my MSc in Games education and in my free time.

		<!-- TA - GAME PROGRAMMING -->
		<h2>
			Teaching Assistant | <em> Game Programming </em>
			<div style="font-size: large;">IT University of Copenhagen</div>
		</h2>
		<p>
			This master's level course teaches efficient C++ programming, design and architecture of game engines for both 2D and 3D graphics, 
			integrating a physics engine, and best practices for game programming from software engineering and system architecture.
		</p>
		<hr/>

		<!-- TA - HIGH PERFORMANCE PROGRAMMING AND SYSTEMS -->
		<h2>
			Teaching Assistant | <em>High Performance Programming and Systems</em>
			<div style="font-size: large;">University of Copenhagen</div>
		</h2>
		<p>
			This bachelor's level course introduces low-level programming in C, computer architecture, networking, 
			memory architecture, operating systems, and task parallelism. 
			I was responsible for helping students online, during in-person exercise sessions, and for grading submissions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Teaching other students and reviewing their code submissions really helped to solidify my understanding of 
			computer architecture and the C programming language.

		<!-- MSc in Games -->
		 <h2>
			Master of Science | <em>Games, Technology Track</em>
			<div style="font-size: large;">IT University of Copenhagen</div>
		 </h2>
		 <p>
			The focus is on programming for games, with courses that introduce engine and graphics programming. 
			We also have courses together with students on the design track, where we learn how to make games and how to work in bigger teams.
		</p>
		<hr/>

		<!-- BSc in Computer Science -->
		 <h2>
			Bachelor of Science | <em>Computer Science</em>
			<div style="font-size: large;">University of Copenhagen</div>
		 </h2>
		 <p>
			The UCPH Department of Computer Science is the highest ranked computer science department in the Nordic countries. 
			The general courses gave me a solid theoretical understanding of software development, computer systems, architecture, datastructures and algorithms. 
			For my elective courses I took <em>Introduction to Graphics Programming</em> and did an internship with <em>BetaDwarf</em>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For my bachelor thesis I researched collision detection and implemented continuous collision detection into a physics simulation library.

		<h2>
			Folk High School | <em>Game Design and Animation</em>
			<div style="font-size: large;">Højer Design Højskole</div>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Danish folk high schools provide single-semester informal education that focuses on personal development. 
			We learned about world building, animation, UX design, etc., as well as various skills important for a career in creative work, 
			such as leadership, entrepreneuership, project managment, etc.

		</p>
		<p>
			Along with the school tasks, I worked in a two person team, to create the game prototype using Unity, C# and Maya. 
			My roles were programming, character modelling and animation.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Gymnasium | <em>Science Line</em>
			<div style="font-size: large;">Føroya Studentaskúli og HF-skeið</div>
		</h2>
		<p>
			My courses focused on mathematics and physics.
			Gymnasium is the term for upper secondary schools in the Danish education system that prepare students for higher education at universities.
